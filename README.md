# CS2
This project is a simple product management system that allows users to add or remove products and calculates prices based on the dollar rate and special values.

Product Management System
This is a C++ console-based Product Management System that allows users to:

• Add products with name, base price, and optional float (special) value

• Remove products from the list

• Display the product list with calculated prices

• Set or update the dollar exchange rate

• Save and load product data from files (product_catalog.txt and dollar_rate.txt)

Features
• Products with a special float value are treated as unique items

• Products without a float value are stackable (quantity-based)

• Calculates prices for two platforms: ByNoGame and CSFloat

• Persistent data storage for products and exchange rate

Files
• main.cpp – main source code

• product_catalog.txt – stores product data

• dollar_rate.txt – stores the dollar exchange rate
